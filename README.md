# Salesforce Indicators

# Status of Code
We are in a bit of a transition phase at the moment and are in active development. 
You can still use the older Indicators List Component and it will work fine, if you already have it installed.
If you would like to test where we are at, install the managed package from the [Installation](../../wiki/Installing-Salesforce-Indicators) page and follow the steps to add the `Indicator Bundle` component to the page layout. 
NOTE: Only test in a Scratch org, Developer org, or Sandbox at the moment whilst we are in active development.
We can't wait to get something stable that you can start to use in your production orgs. 

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
* Build a customisable Indicators Component to help users see the value, status, and key details about a record at a glance and in nice colours and graphics 
* Show different apps you can use to achieve similar results, but you will want to use the Indicators Component
* Future Components
  * An Exceptions Component to quickly show your users issues with their data, and show custom messages for each field
  * A custom highlights panel

## Project Vertical
This Component is a must-have for any Nonprofit org, but it works in any org and any vertical.
