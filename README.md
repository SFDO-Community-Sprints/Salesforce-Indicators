## Vision & Goals
* Enhance the current Indicators Bundle Component to improve the experience for Admins and Users.
* Complete the documentation with different recipes to help Admins get up and running quickly.
* Showcase and review different apps you can use to achieve similar results, and show how you will probably want to use Salesforce Indicators anyway.
* Build our planned Components - these components are built on the same Custom Metadata framework and just show the data in different ways:
  * A Grid Component to quickly show your users excptions or a checklist of fields on the record. Optionally show field values, a custom message for each field, and if the field has an exception. 
  * A Panel Component to provide more value and features than the standard record highlights panel horizontally, or a panel that display the key data vertically.
